# Toward intelligent nanoscopy: A machine learning approach for automated optimization of super-resolution optical microscopy

This repo contains the software to perform online STED imaging optimization according to the paper [Toward intelligent nanoscopy: A machine learning approach for automated optimization of super-resolution optical microscopy](https://tdb). It currently supports Abberior STED microscopes through the Imspector Python Interface [SpecPy](http://imspectordocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specpy.html).
