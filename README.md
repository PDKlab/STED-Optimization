# Toward intelligent nanoscopy: A machine learning approach for automated optimization of super-resolution optical microscopy

This repo contains the software to perform online STED imaging optimization according to the paper [Toward intelligent nanoscopy: A machine learning approach for automated optimization of super-resolution optical microscopy](https://tdb). It currently supports Abberior STED microscopes through the Imspector Python Interface [SpecPy](http://imspectordocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specpy.html).


## Documentation

The documentation is available in the repository. Steps to build:
- install [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org)
- change to the `doc` subfolder
- type in `make html`


## Requirements

- Python3


## More tools

- Download the [packaged GUI](https://goo.gl/) for configuring optimization!
